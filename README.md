# Minimum-Edit-Distance
This program produces the minimum edit distance between two given words, and shows all possible alignments to change one word into the other.


To run the program, execute the file distance.py with two command line arguments that represent the words.

For example, to calculate the alignment and minimum edit distance between "gamble" and "gumbo", the execution would be:

python distance.py gamble gumbo
